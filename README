Amalgam is a system that allows you to generate collections of files that work
with conventional tools but take up minimal extra space on storage.

If you already are archiving files in a file system and don't want to make 
multiple copies of whole files in order to ship the data somewhere then this
system is for you.

Amalgam consists of tools that allow you to create and get information about
'.amalgam' files which contain just the metadata associated with a set of
files. It also contains a fuse file system that, using amalgam files, will
dynamically create traditional tar files. With this setup, you can see
multiple orders of magnitude reduction in storage requirements for temporary
data collections.

For install instructions, see the INSTALL file.

Tools:
amalgamfs    - fuse based file system for reading out traditional collections.
amalgaminfo  - tool to show info about amalgam files.
amalgambuild - tool to build amalgam files.
